## Features

- Upon player death, the current hardcore world is deleted and replaced with a new, freshly generated one.
- All players are instantly teleported to the new world.
- Choose between a seamless teleport (`SEAMLESS`) or disconnecting all players (`DISCONNECT`) until the new world is ready.
- A timer (`HH:MM:SS.ms`) is displayed in the player list.
